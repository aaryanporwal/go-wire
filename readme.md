# What is Wire?
Wire is a code dependency tool that operates without runtime state or reflection. Code written to be used with Wire is useful even for handwritten initialization.

Wire can generate source code at compile time as well as implement dependency injection. According to the official documentation, “In Wire, dependencies between components are represented as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of global variables.”
